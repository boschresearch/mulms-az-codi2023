# text = One of the biggest challenges in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) research is the fabrication of membrane electrode as- semblies (MEAs) with a maximized H2/air performance at high cur- rent densities, which we believe largely depends on the homogeneity of the ionomer distribution particularly within the cathode electrode.
