# text = The catalyst layer ionomer is often described as a binder [5], which does not capture the multiple crucial functions it serves: (i) as an ion-conducting material phase that ensures transport of protons over 10–20 micron thick catalyst layers, (ii) as an acidic medium that together with Pt catalyst forms the electrochemically active interface where the oxygen reduction reaction (cathode) or hydrogen oxidation reactions (anode) occur, and (iii) as a material phase that controls the transport of reactants (O2 or H2) and products to/from the active Pt sites.
